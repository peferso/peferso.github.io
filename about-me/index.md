## Bio

Currently I am a junior Software developer. 

In 2013 I graduated in Physics in my hometown, Murcia (Spain).
During these years I developed an interest in programming, despite the harshness of the language we used: Fortran. 
It definitely made an impact on me how this discipline is applied to simulate complex physical systems on computers.

Guided by that interest, I pursued a Master program in Physics and Mathematics in the University of Granada (Spain).
Although my moving force was to learn more about complex systems (my BS thesis focused on a one-dimensional traffic simulation implementing variations on the Nagel-Schreckeberg model),
I was soon seduced by theoretical Physics subjects, such as Quantum Field Theory and Advanced Quantum Mechanics. In 2014 I completed the Master's theoretical Phyisics specialization, with a thesis about the nucleon-nucleon interaction. This work was the seed of a scientific publication later, which can be checked out [here](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevC.96.014004).

Right after finishing the master I moved to Valencia (Spain), joining the [Hadronic & Nuclear Theory Group](https://ific.uv.es/nucth/research.html) research group, in the [Institute of Corpuscular Physics](https://webific.ific.uv.es/web/). 
There, I started a PhD thesis about effective theories in particle physics with a predoctoral research contract. 
Although the learning curve was pretty steep.. and never seemed to flatten! It was a really nice experience. 
I had the opportunity to collaborate in many research projects, in an international environment with colleagues of different nationalities. 
I also had the chance of communicating our findings, attending international scientific conferences, events and workshops in Spain, China, Japan, USA and Poland. 
My PhD research projects consisted on the development of theoretical models to describe and understand a set of particles called resonances. 
Some of these particles have been measured in experiments, thus, we tested our interpretation of these particles with the existing experimental data. 

Thanks to the research activity I developed strong quantitative programming skills and interest in problem solving. 
The technical topics covered in our research projects involved a wide range of mathematical calculations:  numerical resolution of matrix-algebraic equations, multiparametric data regression of nonlinear models, hypothesis testing, error analysis and propagation, parameter optimisation, data visualization and calculus.

I completed my PhD thesis in 2019 with more than 9 research papers, my scientific publications can be found [here](https://inspirehep.net/literature?sort=mostrecent&size=25&page=1&q=a%20fernandez-soler)
