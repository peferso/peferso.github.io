# Bio

Currently I am a junior Software developer. 

In 2013 I graduated in Physics in my hometown, Murcia (Spain).
During these years I developed an interest in programming, despite the rudiments of the language we used: Fortran. 
It definitely made an impact on me how this discipline was applied to simulate complex physical systems on computers.
Guided by that interest, I pursued a master program in Physics and Mathematics in the University of Granada.
Although my moving force was to learn more about complex systems (my BS thesis focused on a one-dimensional traffic simulation implementing variations on the Nagel-Schreckeberg model),
I was soon seduced by theoretical Physics subjects such as Quantum Field Theory and Advanced Quantum Mechanics.
