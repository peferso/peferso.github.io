## Bio

Currently I am a junior Software developer. 

In 2013 I graduated in Physics in my hometown, Murcia (Spain).
During these years I developed an interest in programming, despite the harshness of the language we used: Fortran. 
It definitely made an impact on me how this discipline was applied to simulate complex physical systems on computers.

Guided by that interest, I pursued a Master program in Physics and Mathematics in the University of Granada.
Although my moving force was to learn more about complex systems (my BS thesis focused on a one-dimensional traffic simulation implementing variations on the Nagel-Schreckeberg model),
I was soon seduced by theoretical Physics subjects, such as Quantum Field Theory and Advanced Quantum Mechanics. I completed the theoretical Phyisics specialization with a master thesis about the nucleon-nucleon interaction. This work was the seed of a scientific publication later, which can be checked out [here](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevC.96.014004)
