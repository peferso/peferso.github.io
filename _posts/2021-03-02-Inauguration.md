This post celebrates the official inauguration of this website. After playing a little bit with GitHub Pages I fell in love with this framework, since creating content using markdown syntax is fairly intuitive!

I begun creating my own cheatsheets about vim, bash, python and other programming languages, and suddenly, started enjoying the process :nerd_face:.
You can check my cheatsheets [here](https://peferso.github.io/cheat-sheets/).

Inspired by this [awesome post](http://varianceexplained.org/r/start-blog/), I decided to take over and start building a personal website on GitHub Pages using Jekyll and markdown syntax. You are browsing it now! Consider it is an open window to let the world see some of my interests. Also, it is a good platform to present my portfolio and the projects undertaken during my professional carrer.

The source of the website can be found in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/peferso/peferso.github.io).
It uses the [minimal-mistakes](https://mademistakes.com/work/minimal-mistakes-jekyll-theme/) jekyll theme.
