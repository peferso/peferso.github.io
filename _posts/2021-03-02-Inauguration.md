This post celebrates the official inauguration of this website. After playing a little bit with GitHub Pages I fell in love with this framework, since creating content using markdown syntax is fairly intuitive!
Inspired by this [awesome post](http://varianceexplained.org/r/start-blog/), I decided to take over and start building a personal website on GitHub Pages using Jekyll and markdown. You are browsing it now! Consider it is an open window to let the world see some of my interests and projects undertaken during my professional carrer.

The source of the website can be found in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/peferso/peferso.github.io).
It uses the [minimal-mistakes](https://mademistakes.com/work/minimal-mistakes-jekyll-theme/) jekyll theme.
